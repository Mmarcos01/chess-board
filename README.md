## Project: Chessboard

Render out chess boards with red and blue queens.

Chess board is an 8 by 8 grid of alternating black and white squares. The queens are red and blue squares.

Each board will have one red and one blue queen at different coordinates. In addition to displaying the board you’ll need to identify if the queens are “under attack” based on their coordinates.

## User Acceptance Tests:

- queens on same row should be “under attack”
- queens on same column should be “under attack”
- queens on same diagonal should be “under attack”
- queens with any other coordinates should NOT be “under attack”
